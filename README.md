System Analysis and Design

DriverPass wanted to create a system to help their students learn to drive and pass the drivers exam. They wanted to create a Learning Managment System and offer instruction that would teach the students the nessecary information to pass their exams. 
I think i did a good job of translating the script given to me into functional business documents, and a plan for the systems creation. 
I would redo the client presentation, I feel I could have created a presentation that was easier to understand and did a better job of explaining the information within. I would change the speakers notes to be better descriptions of the slides. 
I took the interviews given to me, the design documents and the systems main goal and using the three pieces of information I formed a list of requirments that would be needed to operate the system. The user's needs are the most important thing to consider when designing a system. If the user does not like it or it does not meet the requirments they requested there is no need for the system you created to exist. 
I like to start with the low haning fruit, completeing the smallest and easiest tasks first and working my way to the larger tasks. I like the Agile method, I like the ability to pivot at any given time to a different section of the project, this helps keep my mind fresh and keeps me engaged in the work, which will result in a better designed system.
